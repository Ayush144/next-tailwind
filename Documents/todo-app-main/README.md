## My process

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Fauna](https://fauna.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

### What I learned

Perhaps, the biggest lesson that I learnt is small wins matter! I used to drop working on personal projects if I could not finish it in one go, or if I got stuck somewhere. Basically, the change in mindset helped a lot to complete this one. I tackled one feature at a time (have a look at the commits and you'll understand ðŸ˜‰). Public commitment on Twitter also helped!

On the coding front, this was a good practice to test my React and Tailwind CSS skills. First time, I actually used the drag and drop feature. Practiced the JAMstack architecture.

### Continued development

- Code Refactoring: Spaghetti code all around this project. ðŸ˜›
- Responsive Design
- Accessibility

### Useful resources
